# biweekly-report-2-dropout
biweekly-report-2-dropout created by GitHub Classroom

This biweekly report contains 4 submissions. Each of our 3 group memebers took lead on a very applied deep dive into contents from class. Specifically Jackson and Simon worked on Sequence2sequence translation and All you need is Attention transformer translation respectively so they had a lot of overlap and collaboration between their notebooks. These translations followed different sections of a tutorial that lead us through translation and implementations of language datasets from spacy and Multi30k datasets.  Reza implemented his notebook of Sequence Labeling and LSTM implementations. The 4th notebook is a quick EDA/ practice of interfacing with audio data using the JB Chorales piano dataset. Throughout working on these notebooks our collaboration existed through zoom meetings for question/ answering and planning, so many of our individual efforts were taught to one another in those meetings.
