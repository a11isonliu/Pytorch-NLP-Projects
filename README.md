# Pytorch-NLP-Projects CHANGE
This repository contains natural language processing projects I have done using Pytorch.  For many of these projects I have collaborated with Simon Julien and Allison Liu to create the Jupyter Notebooks.  Each folder has an additional README explaining (in detail) the jupyter notebooks and topics that are covered.

## Below I have some visual highlights from each of the folders:

### 1. Generative-Adversarial-Networks
These images show magnetograms, or images of the magnetic field of the sun. The bright patches visible are active regions, or regions where there is a lot of solar activity. All 5 of the models shown were trained using a GPU available through LASP. Pix2Pix uses input-output pairs to train, while CycleGAN and CUT train on distributions of entire datasets, as discussed in class.
