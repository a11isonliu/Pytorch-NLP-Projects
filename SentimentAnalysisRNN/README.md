# biweekly-report-1-reign

In this weeks Bi-Weekly report, we wanted to implement and compare concepts of NLP from our first two weeks of class, while also warming up to the languages and packages that we will need to be fluent with as we continue with the course. The structure of this repository consists of "individual" investigations (we still had verbal communication and questioning throughout) from each of the three members of team reign. Within these individual investigations, we each followed tutorials to teach us the ML language that we know the least. For Simon and Jackson this was PyTorch, and for Allison this was TensorFlow/ Keras. Additionally in our personal notebooks we took a deeper dive into implementing one of the following three concepts from class: Continuous Bag of Words, Convolutional Neural Networks for NLP, and Recursive Neural Network for NLPs. 

After our three individual investigations, we wanted to round out our repository with a far more collaborative notebook that we all edited and added to simultaneously and interchangably. In this notebook, we each taught eachother the implementation strategy from class that we individually worked on in our personal notebooks. This lead to us all participating and being involved in implementations of CBOW, CNN, and RNN. It also allowed us to compare the different models to understand the advantages of each and what ones participated best in sentence classification specifically. With this explaination, the notebooks in the repo correspond accordingly:

Allison_CNN_Sentence_Classification -- Allision Liu's personal notebook and investigation into TensorFlow and CNN in application to sentence classification. Allison used rotten tomatoes movie reviews as her dataset for investigation.  

JacksonRNNMovieReviewsTutorial, Jackson -- Jackson Curry's personal notebook and investigation into PyTorch and RNNs (and exploratory data analysis). Jackson used IMBD reviews as his dataset for investigation. 

SimonJulien_Implementation_of_Continuous_Bag_of_words  -- Simon Julien's personal notebook and investigation into PyTorch and Continuous Bag of words in application to classification and prediction through embeddings. Simon used smaller example dataset's with a handful of sentences that were given in various tutorials.

GroupExerciseComparison  -- The highly collaborative notebook where Simon, Jackson, and Allison worked together to teach eachother BOW, CNN, RNN's for NLP, and to compare the performances between each method. 

*Collaboration remained consistent thurought the creation of all these documents. Even on the "personal" notebooks, the team members of reign verbally checked in and supported eachother with useful tutorials, websites, or ideas that helped eachother complete their implementation.*
